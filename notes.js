/*
Time complexity
    Omega (Ω)
        best case scenario or lower bound
    Theta (θ)
        average case scenario or tightest bound 
        best of all worst case scenarios
    Big-Oh (O)
        worst case scenario or upper bound
    always use Big O for time complexity
    avoid constants
    avoid lower values 
Space complexity
    memory space
    always use Big O for space complexity
    Auxilary space + input space
    Auxilary space
        the space that u take to solve the problem
    input space
        the space that u take to store the input
        
Tips 
    never modify the input while solving problem
    most servers take 1s for 10^8 operations
